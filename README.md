# bubble-trouble-final-project

Game development final project in Software Engineering College

## Introduction

In this project I implemented my OOP, C# and game development knowledge that I got to learn during the thirteenth grade of Software Engineering at Hakfar Hayarok College.
This is a 2D game ran using Monogame (open-source and cross-platform game development framework) and XNA framework integrated within it.

"Bubble Trouble" is a two-dimensional game with artificial intelligence (Bot) in which two characters compete with each other.￼￼￼
The main goal of the game is to hit as many of your balls as possible in order to gain a higher score.
Each player has health and a number of points.
A game ends as soon as one of the players runs out of life or as soon as the time runs out, and the player with the higher score wins.
