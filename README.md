Game development final project in Software Engineering College

## Introduction

In this project I implemented my OOP, C# and game development knowledge that I got to learn during the thirteenth grade of Software Engineering at Hakfar Hayarok College.
This is a 2D game ran using Monogame (open-source and cross-platform game development framework) and XNA framework integrated within it. 
</br>
The game is a two-dimensional game with artificial intelligence (Bot) in which two characters compete with each other.￼￼￼
The main goal of the game is to hit as many of your balls as possible in order to gain a higher score.
Each player has a number of lives and a number of points.
A game ends as soon as one of the players runs out of life or as soon as the time runs out, and the winner is determined by the amount of points the two have earned.
